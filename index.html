Its first version was written in Ruby, however in the later versions, use of Ruby has been deprecated and replaced by JavaScript. The indented syntax of Less is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid Less code with the same semantics. Less provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and functions; the main difference between Less and other CSS precompilers being that Less allows real-time compilation via less.js by the browser.">LESS</a>  </li>

The original syntax, called &quot;the indented syntax&quot;, uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, &quot;SCSS&quot;, uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss respectively.">Sass</a>  </li>

It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications. With the rise of the single-page web app and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages. In particular, Emscripten and highly optimised JIT compilers, in tandem with asm.js that is friendly to AOT compilers like OdinMonkey, have enabled C and C++ programs to be compiled into JavaScript and execute at near-native speeds, making JavaScript be considered the &quot;assembly language of the web&quot;, according to its creator and others.">Javascript</a>  </li>

              <p><strong>Lexus “Check-In For Charity” Facebook Application</strong> : The Facebook App was built to promote Lexus’ December Sales Event, and help raise money for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America by donating money for every check-in a user
                made within the app. We used the Codeigniter framework, and I built the views on-top of Twitter Bootstrap. The check-in data was pulled in from the Facebook Places &amp; Foursquare APIs, and we also used the Bing Maps API to create a custom
                map to visualize the check-ins. The promotion was a huge success and met its goal just over a week after being launched.</p>
              <p><strong>Lexus.com Performance page</strong> : The Performance page was being updated as part of a full site redesign. I wrote the markup to hook into the responsive framework that Team One had built in-house. It’s powered by CSS media queries
                and Javascript initialized by break-point. The JS was written using the modular design pattern so that any functionality may be inherited if desired. All videos are served via the Brightcove API. I was also tasked with Omniture integration
                that tracks visitor behavior granularly with custom event handlers for all user actions.</p>
