            <h3>Welcome to ME</h3>
            <p>This is the web presence of Jason Paul Cole, and although I'm not a huge fan of labels I also understand and appreciate their purpose in allowing us to describe ourselves and our interests to one another</p>
            <h4>My top interests</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Web development, mainly client-side focused, with server-side understanding</li>
                <li>Design, various types</li>
                <li>Visual art, classic to modern</li>
                <li>Sound, music and science, consumption and production</li>
                <li>Film, classic to Troma</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills I use to pay the bills</h4>
            <p>I write codes and build web sites and web applications. As a front-end web developer I am skilled in the following programming languages (plus their libraries/frameworks listed), and have worked with them in a production environment in a professional setting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong> 4 and 5, plus a brief side-trek into XHTML.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS</strong> 2 and 3, with pre-processor experience - from most to least - SASS/LESS/Stylus. With SASS I've used the Compass/Bourbon/Neat libraries.</li>
                <li><strong>Javascript</strong> Not having jQuery available is not an issue, pure JS I know well. I am comfortable using jQuery, and have a solid understanding of design patterns. My MVC experience extends to Backbone and Underscore, with Handlebars for templating.</li>
                <li>CMS</li>
                <li>Blog frameworks</li>
                <li>Versioning</li>
                <li><strong>Development environments</strong> I've done the majority of my work on teams in a LAMP stack, with Java/Tomcat coming in a close second. I've also spent time in a couple Ruby on Rails teams, and once worked with the Unity Game System.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Project hilights</h4>
            <p>I've worked on a brain melting volume of web work, small updates to personal blogs all the way up to complex code architecting and development for major corporation's high-volume web sites. Here are a few of the projects that turned out well and stand a little bit taller than the rest, or they involve an interesting technology that would be considered cool by most.</p>

            <p class="about">Hi, you made it to the bottom of the page! I feel like I owe you something for making the effort. I assume you've come to the conclusion that this is a website about a guy who writes codes, spends a good chunk of his time and energy on music consumption, sifting through motion picture releases, all while caring for 3 cat's current needs. Well, although that's not an incorrect conclusion to come to, it definitely is an incomplete list of this site's curator's available topics of knowledge and areas of interest that he can assist others with questions and answers, points of interest, little known facts, and cool entertainment that may or may not teach you something at the same time. Are you confused at all, yet, or not at all? In any case, navigate your variably understood self to the right of this very text, using the beautifully formatted, impeccably ordered, obsessively curated, list of hyperlinks to a veritable smorgasbord of web content in a rainbow of different subjects, media that will stimulate every one of your senses in a dizzying combination spanning the history of technology. This is the best of the best, a personal collection of links collected over years of browsing and digging and googling. If DJ Shadow was a web developer instead of a beat maker, digging up tasty nuggets of web site content, this would be his latest mixtape. So gather round now people and click yourself up and scroll down past the fold to the real gold. This is JasonCo.de's Webdev Bookmark Mixlist</p>

With a plethora of flavors in a solid lineup of available combinations, the personal standout is the Jolly Joes (solo grape), standing a clear leader. Just Born also makes marshmallow Peeps, the vile confection. Heaven and Hell created out of the same machine in a good vs. evil, light battles dark in a coating of sugar.</small>

                        <small>Experimental video artist's film dump featuring most of his best released work, ready to stream. His work with Plaid is a personal favorite, but he's also done video for musicians such as Fatboy Slim and OK Go. His video work is non-traditional at the very least, using a variety of material and technique to obtain illusive, abnormal and visually dazzling visual effects that mesh with the neo-electro polyrhythmic audio conjured up by Andy Turner and Ed Handley of duo Plaid.</small>

                        <h5>Loom of Ruin</h5>
                        <small>Sam McPheeters, of hardcore legend Born Against and experimental post-modern Men's Recovery Project, with a stint in Wrangler Brutes rounding out his musical pedigree. A more than competent visual artist with a clear and developed style, he designs print materials for all the bands on Vermiform, the now-defunct record label he started and ran. The Locust, Towel, Sinking Body, and other inspired post-hardcore outfits made up the VMFM stable. Loom of Ruin, in this incarnation,  is the personal blog of McPheeters. News, opinion, unearthed gems from his past magazine columns, and widely agreed as the icing on this cake of a web property - the articles. Hilarious in a way unmatched, living in a world impossible yet familiar, dense with detail. </small>
